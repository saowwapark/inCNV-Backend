A tab-delimited report based on each variant at a location on the genome for which data have been submitted to ClinVar.  
The data for the variant are reported for each assembly, so most variants have a line for GRCh37 (hg19) and another line for GRCh38 (hg38).
 
Please note: Beginning in October 2016, this file was modified to restrict reporting to attributes of an AlleleID, not a mixture of AlleleID and VariationID.  The modifications were announced in our September 2016 release notes:  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/release_notes/20160901_data_release_notes.pdf.

             The last file that reported VariationID was ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/archive/variant_summary_2016-09.txt.gz
             The first with the new set of columns is ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/archive/variant_summary_2016-10.txt.gz
             Content that used to be in this file may be found in 
                    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/hgvs4variation.txt.gz
                    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/variation_allele.txt.gz

Please note: Beginning in November 2019, the values for referenceAllele and alternateAllele are being written according to the VCF
             standard.  For single nucleotide variants there was no change in the value.

             See also the authoritative file for identifiers assigned to genes represented by NCBI, namely:
                    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz

AlleleID               integer value as stored in the AlleleID field in ClinVar  (//Measure/@ID in the XML)
Type                   character, the type of variant represented by the AlleleID
Name                   character, ClinVar's preferred name for the record with this AlleleID
GeneID                 integer, GeneID in NCBI's Gene database, reported if there is a single gene, otherwise reported as -1.
GeneSymbol             character, comma-separated list of GeneIDs overlapping the variant
HGNC_ID                string, of format HGNC:integer, reported if there is a single GeneID. Otherwise reported as '-'
ClinicalSignificance   character, comma-separated list of aggregate values of clinical significance calculated for this variant
                       If the value is 'no interpretation for the single variant', this allele was submitted to
                       ClinVar as part of a haplotype or genotype, and its specific significance has not been submitted to ClinVar.
                       NOTE: Now that the aggregate values of clinical significance give precedence to records
                             with assertion criteria and evidence, the values in this column may appear to be in
                             conflict with the value reported in ClinSigSimple. 
ClinSigSimple          integer, 0 = no current value of Likely pathogenic or Pathogenic
                                1 = at least one current record submitted with an interpretation of Likely pathogenic or
                                    Pathogenic (independent of whether that record includes assertion criteria and evidence).
                               -1 = no values for clinical significance at all for this variant or set of variants; used for
                                    the "included" variants that are only in ClinVar because they are included in a
                                    haplotype or genotype with an interpretation
                       NOTE: Now that the aggregate values of clinical significance give precedence to records with
                             assertion criteria and evidence, the values in this column may appear to be in conflict with the
                             value reported in ClinicalSignificance.  In other words, if a submission without assertion criteria and
                             evidence interpreted an allele as pathogenic, and those with assertion criteria and evidence interpreted
                             as benign, then ClinicalSignificance would be reported as Benign and ClinSigSimple as 1.
LastEvaluated          date, the latest date any submitter reported clinical significance
RS# (dbSNP)            integer, rs# in dbSNP, reported as -1 if missing

ChromosomeAccession    Accession and version of the RefSeq sequence defining the position reported in the start and stop columns.

ReviewStatus           character, highest review status for reporting this measure. For the key to the terms, 
                           and their relationship to the star graphics ClinVar displays on its web pages, 
                           see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/variation_report/#interpretation
									Note also that 'no interpretation for the single variant' is used for AlleleIDs in ClinVar
									that were submitted as part of the definition of a complex allele, but not interpreted
									individually.
NumberSubmitters       integer, number of submitters describing this variant
Guidelines             character, ACMG only right now, for the reporting of incidental variation in a Gene 
                       enumerates whether the guideline is from 2013 (ACMG2013, PubMed 23788249) or 2016 (ACMG2016, PubMed 27854360)
                               (NOTE: if ACMG, not a specific to the AlleleID but to the Gene in which the AlleleID is found)
TestedInGTR            character, Y/N for Yes/No if there is a test registered as specific to this variant 
                          in the NIH Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)
OtherIDs               character, list of other identifiers or sources of information about this variant
SubmitterCategories    coded value to indicate whether data were submitted by another resource (1), any other type of source (2) or both (3)
VariationID            The identifier ClinVar uses specific to the AlleleID.  Not all VariationIDS that may be related to
                           the AlleleID are reported in this file. For a comprehensive mapping of AlleleID to VariationID,
									please use ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/variation_allele.txt.gz.
							      Note also that some of the values for VariationID are not supported in the current
									default web display, but will be reported from ClinVar 2.0 as current seen from our preview site.
